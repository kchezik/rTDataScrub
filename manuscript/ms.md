#Abstract

#Introduction

Ecological data are inherently difficult to collect and as funding for longitudinal and labor intensive studies has declined, researchers have increasingly turned to digital technologies to approximate processes that traditionally would have been observed more directly. Digitial tools dramatically reduce the cost of data collection but are often indirect measures of the biological question which leads to added noise and uncertainty in the results. Digital data compensates for uncertainty by collecting large amounts of data at higher temporal and spatial resolutions than could be accomplished by even well funded tradtional approaches. For example, Lidar is a remote sensing tool used to collect three dimensional images. A single flight over a forest can map individual trees and be used to measure forest growth, canopy density, terrain topology, photosynthetic rate and even species composition. Currently Lidar has steep upfront costs but like many technologies, these costs are falling dramatically. 

Water temperature governs aquatic biological processes and is a fundamental and essential component to understanding aquatic ecology. .... Flowing water is especially thermally dynamic and essential to understanding lotic freshwater ecological systems.

Monitoring stream water temperature has become a relatively trival and routine task due to the development of relatively cheap, long-lived, small and environmentally robust temperature sensors. As a result, sensors are being deployed at increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution, resulting in exponentially growing volumes of data even for the simplest of studies.
