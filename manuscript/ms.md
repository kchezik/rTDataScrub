#Abstract

#Introduction

Ecological data are often difficult and expensive to collect and despite increasing need for broad-scale ecological studies driven by our rapidly changing climate, funding for robust longitudinal studies has tended to decline. In response, researchers are increasingly relying on digital remote sensing technologies to approximate processes that traditionally would have been observed more directly. Digital tools can dramatically reduce the cost of data collection but are often indirect measures of the biological process in question. Increased uncertainty do the proximal nature of these data is often compensated for in volume at higher spatial and temporal resolution than could be accomplished by even well funded tradtional approaches. For example, Lidar is a remote sensing tool used to collect three dimensional images. A single flight over a forest can map individual trees and be used to measure forest growth, canopy density, terrain topology, photosynthetic rate and even species composition. Although a technology like Lidar is currently expensive, these tools are often cost shared across research projects and labs while in the future, production efficiencies will reduce the cost and miniturize the tool. This process has already played out in many other sensor technologies like GPS, oxygen sensors, light sensors and temperature sensors. The cost reduction and miniturization of these technologies have made mass implimentation easy and affordable.

Water temperature governs aquatic biological processes and is a fundamental and essential component to understanding aquatic ecology. .... Flowing water is especially thermally dynamic and essential to understanding lotic freshwater ecological systems.

Monitoring stream water temperature has become a relatively trival and routine task due to the development of relatively cheap, long-lived, small and environmentally robust temperature sensors. As a result, sensors are being deployed at increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution, resulting in exponentially growing volumes of data even for the simplest of studies.
