#Abstract

#Introduction

Ecological data are often expensive to collect in effort and capital but due to climate change important ecological questions increasingly require spatially and temporally comprehensive investigation. As funding for longitudinal and labor intensive studies declines, researchers are increasingly relying on digital technologies to approximate processes that traditionally would have been observed more directly. Digitial tools can dramatically reduce the cost of data collection but are often indirect measures of the biological process in question. Increased uncertainty do the proximal nature of these data is often compensated for in volume at higher spatial and temporal resolution than could be accomplished by even well funded tradtional approaches. For example, Lidar is a remote sensing tool used to collect three dimensional images. A single flight over a forest can map individual trees and be used to measure forest growth, canopy density, terrain topology, photosynthetic rate and even species composition. Although Lidar is a costly technology 

Water temperature governs aquatic biological processes and is a fundamental and essential component to understanding aquatic ecology. .... Flowing water is especially thermally dynamic and essential to understanding lotic freshwater ecological systems.

Monitoring stream water temperature has become a relatively trival and routine task due to the development of relatively cheap, long-lived, small and environmentally robust temperature sensors. As a result, sensors are being deployed at increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution, resulting in exponentially growing volumes of data even for the simplest of studies.
