# rTDataScrub

This package aims to identify varied sources of temperature data in an unsupervised way to reduce the time and energy wasted on cleaning field water temperature measurements. Ultimately, this recipe of algorithms will simply use the observed temperature data to parse the varied sources such as water, air or earth temperature when sensors are in the water column, dewatered and exposed to the air or buried by the riverbed.
